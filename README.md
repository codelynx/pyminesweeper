# Mine Sweeeper with PYGAME

`pyminesweeper` is a game written in Python with PyGame.  The purpose of this source code is
for me (Kaz Yoshikawa) to learn Python 2.x.  You can click to open a cell, or you can right
click to toggle flags.  You may find number of bombs in upper right bar (assuming your flags
are all correct).  The game is end if you opened any bomb in a cell, or you located and defused
all bombs on the board.  It does not offer you to play again, but it is just sufficient
for learning python language.

Unlike typical minesweeper, this code reveals one of the largest safe cell cluster on the
board in the beginning of the game.  So you don't have to cross your finger to click a few 
cells randomly to test your luck.


## Configurations

you may change number of cells on board, and number of bombs by changing the following lines

```
NUM_OF_ROWS = 10
NUM_OF_COLS = 20
NUM_OF_BOMBS = 15

```

Enjoy ðŸ˜€
